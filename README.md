# Project: Micro-Reddit

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-micro-reddit

## Introduction

In this project, you’ll get to spend some quality time with models. We will be doing some data modeling and putting your active record knowledge to practice by building your own light weight Reddit clone.

### Assignment

Let’s build Reddit. Well, maybe a very junior version of it called micro-reddit. In this project, you’ll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. We won’t build a front end for it because we don’t need to… you can use the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.

## Note (04/10/25)

I forgot to put a post project review when I finished this project. Took me a day or two to complete, so it was fairly straightforward.
